⚠️ Important Notices

💾 Always make a backup before installing any module
🚫 Do not use alongside modules like FDE.AI, Aionix, or others that tweak performance (may cause conflict)
✅ Can be easily uninstalled via Magisk
⚠️ Use at your own risk (tested and functional, but behavior may vary by device)

*AIONIX IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE LATEST VERSIONS THANKS TO THE ANTI-CONFLICT SYSTEM, DO NOT USE IT TOGETHER WITH FDE.AI, IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE, CHOOSE SPEEDCOOL, IT'S BETTER.*
