Better support for non-standard sensors and commands.
- Smarter and more accurate temperature control.
- Improved conflict detection with modules and governors.
- Safer boot process to prevent errors or duplication.
- Clean uninstall that restores original settings.

**v2.2BETA**
- What's New in SpeedCool v2.2
- Automatic App-Based Profiles: app_monitor.sh detects the foreground app and switches performance profiles automatically based on defined rules.
- Full Auto-Update via GitHub: SpeedCool checks for updates, downloads the .zip, and installs it automatically using auto_update.sh.
- Profile Backup & Import: Use profile_tools.sh export to save settings and import to restore them—directly in Termux.
- Extended Device Compatibility: Improved support for rare chipsets (Unisoc, Rockchip, HiSilicon, Tensor, etc.); Automatic fallback if governors/schedulers are unavailable; Safety checks in compatibility.sh prevent risky settings.
- Bootloop Recovery System (Safe Restore): Detects repeated reboots and automatically restores the safe “eco” profile.
- Modular Script Design: Separate scripts for performance, cooling, learning, app monitoring, updates, backups, etc.; Each can run or restart independently if needed.
- Improved Interactive Menu: New: “Check for Update Now”; Better visual feedback with icons like ✓, ⚠️, and real-time status; Integrated backup and refined log options.
- Smarter Conflict Detection: Enhanced scan for governors, thermal zones, and modules; Applies fixes with minimal interference and shows alerts in Termux.
- Detailed Logs & Debugging: Logs adaptive engine decisions, write attempts, and sensor data; Ensures proper permissions and verifies directories at boot.
- More Sensitive Thermal Optimizer (cooling.sh): Reads real temps from multiple sensors; Acts quickly when overheating is detected, even outside “Learning” mode.

**v2.2**
- What was new in the v2.2 beta release: Smart engine that learns usage patterns and automatically adjusts performance; Eco Mode activates automatically after 1 AM during idle periods; Modern, colorful interface designed for Termux; Real-time stats for CPU, RAM, GPU, battery, and more; Full support for both Portuguese and English.
- What changed from the beta to the final release: Real sensor validation: only functional sensors are used, preventing false readings and unnecessary loops; Safer backup system: the script checks if the .tar.gz file is intact before importing — if it's corrupted, it aborts; Refined permissions: scripts can now be executed manually with secure permissions (0755); configs remain protected (0700); Final release flag: added an internal marker (final_release.flag) to identify this version as stable; Robust auto-update: validates the .zip before applying, restarts services, and cleans up temp files — all automatically; Clearer logs and notifications: messages now explain each step more transparently.

**v2.3**

- Typing "speedcool" in Termux opens the main menu.
- Smarter and more stable automatic mode.
- Internal fixes and script improvements.
- Better sensor detection and clearer error messages.
